ðŸ‘‰ This prompt tells the AI to **generate all pages** with **unique content** while sharing the same **style, navbar, and footer**.

Would you like me to now **expand this prompt into ready-to-use starter code for each page** (so you get `index.html`, `about.html`, etc. with placeholders filled), or keep it as a master prompt you can paste into your AI builder?
